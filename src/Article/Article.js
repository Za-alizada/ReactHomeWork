                The IT Infrastructure Library is not a standard and thus there exists no auditing criteria
                for verifying the ITIL® conformance by an organization. For many years, the
                choice for third party verification was either ISO 9001 or BS 15000-1. ISO 9001 is a
                quality management standard from the International Organization for Standardization
                (ISO). Originally developed for manufacturing, about one-third of ISO 9001
                users are not manufacturers, but rather service sector companies, including IT
                organizations.
                The British Standards Institute (BSI) created British Standard BS 15000-1 as an
                audit standard, and while it was not an international standard, it did deliver specifications
                for managing IT, implementing the ITIL®, and establishing audit criteria
                and corporate-level certification. Although used primarily in the United Kingdom,
                BS 15000-1 has had some traction elsewhere in the world. However, following in
                the path of ISO 9001, the BSI submitted BS 15000-1 to the ISO and in December
                2005, the ISO released it as ISO 20000. Now, for the first time, IT has its own dedicated
                international standard for auditing and certifying conformance to best
                practice.
